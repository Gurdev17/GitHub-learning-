        <h2><i><b> Not really, I think software development for the majority of people working in the field is either about having a very high aptitude and propensity to learn new things or having a high dedication to the field and passion for it.

       <u><h1><i><b>You currently work as a Software Developer for Raizlabs. What does this title mean and what does a normal day at work look like for you?</b></i></h1></u>
    <h2><i><b>I’m a member of the web team at Raizlabs. My normal day at work consists of writing some code, reviewing others code, or learning about new technologies to use in future projects and give internal tech talks. For example, recently I’ve been building some basic AR applications in React-Native using Three.js and ARKit in javascript or building a custom NLP engine using spaCy in Python. I specialize in front-end development in javascript but also hop on projects that utilize a variety of backends including Node or Rails</b></i></h2>
