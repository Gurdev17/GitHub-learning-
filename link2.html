        Programming is about managing complexity: the complexity of the problem,laid upon
        the complexity of the machine. Because of this complexity, most of our programming projects fail.
        <br>“Managers of programming projects aren’t always aware that certain programming
        issues are matters of projects. If you’re a manager and you try to require compliance
        with certain programming practices, you’re inviting your programmers"</br>
